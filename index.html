                <h1 class="box-em matter-html">About Me</h1>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Hello! I'm Frankie and I love to make games! I have been programming since 2013 and have been fascinated with video games ever since I could hold a controller. Growing up, I have competed in multiple robotics teams throughout my middle/high
                    school years.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">I have experience programming in many languages including C#, C, C++, Python, Java, and Javascript, but my favorite language is C# because I enjoy and have experience developing my games in Unity.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Currently I am a third-year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Game Design and Development. I am using my time here to develop my game designing skills and to build a portfolio I am proud of.</p>

                <h1 class="box-em matter-html">My Interests</h1>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Puzzle games are my favorite! I have always loved spending time analyzing puzzles and the problem-solving aspect that comes with them. My interest in puzzle games is definitely reflected in my portfolio seeing as I love developing and
                    designing puzzles in addition to solving them.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">I am also very interested in randomness and procedural generation in games. Randomness is a great way to infinitely expand upon any game idea and make each gameplay experience unique from the last.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">My favorite aspects of game development are gameplay programming and level design. Over the few years I have been at college, I have also grown an interest for web development and UI design.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Outside of technology, I find space fascinating and love learning about how the universe works. I also like to take walks or ride my bike when I can to stay active.</p>
