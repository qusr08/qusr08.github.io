                <p class="box-reg">This website was created for Gabriela Colón-Meléndez to display her work and projects. She is a 4th year Industrial Design major at the <a href="https://vt.edu/"><span>Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University</span></a>. She has created many different types of projects over the course of her studies thus far, and her goal was to have a place that she could show to businesses and companies as an all-encompassing portfolio.</p>
                <p class="box-reg">The layout of the website is similar to mine, where there are square buttons previewing each of the projects added to the website in a list. Clicking on one will bring you to a page that displays various images showing the design process and final images for that project. Gabriela wanted a minimalistic design so we chose to go with pastel/muted colors with not much variation in the look of the elements. We worked side-by-side throughout the duration of the project, bouncing ideas off each other. Since I was making the website for Gabriela, I made sure to take her ideas into consideration and give suggestions along the way that I felt would be helpful. I did all of the HTML and CSS development along with some user interface assets, and Gabriela provided all of the project pictures and her logo.</p>

                <h1 class="box-em">My Thoughts</h1>
                <p class="box-reg">This project made me realize how much I enjoy website design, and how much fun I find it to be as I am able to help someone out in the process. Website development vastly differs from game development, but I find great satisfaction when I’m capable of working through how to create an aesthetic and functional design. I love being creative and I am always looking to improve my art skills, making website development right up my alley. This project will be in development as long as Gabriela keeps adding projects to it. In the future, I definitely want to develop other websites, whether it's for someone I know personally like Gabriela, or freelance clients that I may acquire.</p>
