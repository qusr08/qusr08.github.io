                <p class="box-reg">In <strong>Prichi</strong>, you are playing a roguelike game of chess against the computer. You only control one white queen against a randomly generated army of opposing black pieces. Each black piece moves every 4 turns, indicated by a counter next to it. Some of these pieces also have special abilities that allow them to alter the game board or make them harder to capture. The goal of the game is to capture all of the black pieces on each board and survive as many boards as possible. You only get one life, so you need to make sure your moves are calculated and thought out.</p>
                <p class="box-reg">This game was created for the class Introduction to Web Technology for Game Developers at the Rochester Institute of Technology. The prompt for this project was simply "make a game using Javascript", which allows for a lot of creative freedom. I find that my projects have a better final result when prompts are open-ended and allow me more freedom to create something more in line with what I've envisioned and am passionate about. I created this project entirely on my own for the class and received playtesting and/or critiques from my teachers/classmates/friends as I was developing.</p>
                <p class="box-reg">The random generation of the game boards in <strong>Prichi</strong> took a long time to get to the point it is now. I programmed the generation in a series of steps to not only make it easy to understand when reading the code, but also so it is easy to explain. To make the general shape of the map, a walker randomly picks a direction to travel to each iteration of a loop, for a certain number of times. The number of times depends on how many rounds the player has survived, so the difficulty ramps up the longer the player survives. This generates a random path on the screen that will be used for the general shape of the map. If the walker navigates itself into a dead end with nowhere to go, then the loop is broken no matter if the correct number of iterations has been reached. This adds much more variation to the board shapes. To smooth out the map, each position that the walker reached has tiles placed in all 8 directions around that position (top-left, top, top-right, etc.). This will remove many of the holes in the map and make it easier for pieces to navigate around the game board. Now that the map is created, the white and black pieces can be placed. The number of black pieces placed on the game board depends on the round number (so the difficulty of the game increases the longer you survive) and the size of the randomly generated board. For each piece, a random position is chosen on the board that is not currently occupied. Then a random number is generated between 1 and 4 for the number of turns left until it moves. This offsets the black pieces at the start of the game so they all don't move at once, staggering them to make the gameplay more interesting. If the player is playing "insane" mode, then a random ability has a chance to be put on the piece as well. This chance is also dependent on the number of rounds the player has currently survived. Currently, the player only controls one white piece, but the original idea of the game was that the player would control multiple white pieces. Through playtesting I realized that having one piece makes the game more fun and challenging, so I stuck with that. This step still has to randomly place a white piece, similar to how black pieces are placed.</p>

                <h1 class="box-em">My Thoughts</h1>
                <p class="box-reg">I love how this game turned out and how it plays. The name is a combination of the two Italian words "prigione" which means dungeon, and "scacchi" which means chess. I want to keep the gameplay of the game as simple as possible but still make it require some strategy and thought. It might not be the most exciting gameplay because the black pieces move at random, but I think the overall concept is really interesting. My favorite genre of games are puzzle games, and a very close second is roguelike. This game has aspects of both a roguelike and a puzzle game, and I believe with more mechanics added to the gameplay, this game could become something really special. However, I am unsure if I want to continue making the game. If I do continue it, I want to remake it in Unity instead of Javascript because I feel that I will be able to achieve a more polished final product that way.</p>
