                    <strong>Collab</strong> is a 2-player puzzle platforming game where you need to work together to solve various puzzles. Each player can switch their character between four different forms: normal mode, boost mode, shrink mode, and
                    swap mode. Normal mode is the default state of the characters, boost mode allows the player to jump higher, shrink mode allows the player to shrink and fit into smaller gaps, and swap mode allows the players to switch positions. Using
                    these character forms, the players need to navigate around various obstacles like doors, pits, and high ledges. There is a twist, however, that makes the puzzles more challenging. Both players have a combined limit to how many times
                    they can switch forms, so they need to be careful and smart about which forms they switch into. Both players need to reach the end of the level to complete it!

                    This game was created as a personal side project as an opportunity to add a complete game to my collection/portfolio that was created in Unity. My friend Joseph Ferrugio created the song used in the game, but aside from that I created the game entirely
                    on my own. This game really helped me understand Unity and C# and grew my confidence in my game-creating abilities.

                    I really enjoyed creating this game and still look back on it as one of the best projects I have ever created. I find the puzzle mechanic to be especially unique and fun to mess around with. The movement and animations in the game I also think are very
                    smooth and satisfying, which adds to the charm of the game. The game took me about 2 months to make in full, and I went from very little Unity experience to getting a significant portion of the game development process. At the time
                    I had plans to extend the game and take it further, where I would flesh out the sprites and make the game much longer, maybe even adding in a story. However, now I think it should be left in the past as a piece of my game development
                    history.
