                <p>
                    <strong>Blockchain</strong> is a puzzle game that revolves around chaining various blocks together. Each block has different properties that allow them to be able to stick to some other blocks or slide past them. You must create different
                    shapes in order to avoid falling into the abyss below. Navigate your way to the white button in each level to win!
                </p>
                <p>
                    This game was created for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2021">2021 Game Maker's Toolkit 48 Hour Game Jam</a>. The theme for the jam was "Joined Together", and my partner for this project, Joseph Ferrugio, and I decided to take
                    the theme literally and make a game about joining blocks together. The idea was straightforward and intuitive for players to figure out quickly, which is always very good for game jam games where people play them for a couple of minutes
                    on average. We created all of the assets used in the game between ourselves, all within 48 hours. Since this was the first game jam either of us had attempted, we were shooting for the top 50% of submissions. We ended up placing in
                    the top 10% out of over 6000 submissions, with our game also being top 2% in the fun category.

                <p>
                    I am very proud of the final product of this game and am glad I partook in the jam. I find grid-based puzzle games like <strong>Blockchain</strong> to be very fun to make and develop mechanics for. Joseph Ferrugio and I had other ideas
                    for mechanics to implement that would make the gameplay more interesting, but we ran out of time within the 48 hours to actually figure out how to create them. Currently, I am on the fence about developing this game further into a
                    more polished and professional game. I can see this game being a simple mobile game, but I can also see it being a more complex puzzle experience.
