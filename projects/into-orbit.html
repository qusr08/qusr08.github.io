                <h1>Game Summary</h1>
                <p>
                    <strong>Into Orbit</strong> is a gravity puzzle game where you launch a spaceship around planets. It is similar to games like Angry Birds, but instead of the objects you launch following simple parabolas, they follow complex gravitational
                    fields that pull them along. You have no control over the ship once it has been launched, so you need to make sure it was launched at the correct angle and speed to properly avoid all of the planets. There are various obstacles that
                    can get in your way as well, like walls between planets, gates that need to be opened, and asteroids. The goal of the game is to reach the wormhole without crashing.

                    This game was created off of a random idea I was messing around with in Unity. I made a gravity simulation where objects can be launched at a certain angle and power and get pulled around by the gravity of planets. I showed this idea to Joseph Ferrugio
                    and we brainstormed ideas to turn it into a game. Joseph Ferrugio and I even had plans to make a story that went along with the game. The story was going to be about a war prisoner stealing a spacecraft from the opposing side of the
                    war, escaping with intelligence that could aid his side. Throughout the game, the player would be running away from enemy ships and would have to make various decisions as they try to make it back to their home planet. Overall, I think
                    the ideas we came up with are interesting, we just never added them in.

                    I had fun creating this project, but I do not look back on it as one of my best game ideas. The idea is pretty simple, and the puzzle mechanics in their current state are not the most interesting. I also dislike that the player has no control over the
                    ship after it has launched because the gameplay boils down to finding the proper launch angle and speed. I feel that this game could be given more substance with more interesting gameplay mechanics, but as of now it can sometimes get
                    boring fairly quickly. I do not have any plans to take this game any further as I feel like I have moved on from the idea.
