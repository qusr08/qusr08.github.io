                <h1 class="box-em matter-html">About Me</h1>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Hello! I'm Frankie and I love to make games! I have been programming since middle school and have been fascinated with video games ever since I could hold a controller. I have been heavily involved in robotics as well and have competed
                    on multiple teams throughout middle school and high school. I have programmed in many languages like C#, C, C++, Python, Java, and Javascript, but I think my favorite language is C#. I use Unity a lot to develop my games and am fairly
                    familiar with the engine. Over the few years I have been at college, I have also grown a liking for web development and UI design.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Currently I am a third-year student at the Rochester Institute of Technology studying Game Design and Development. I am using my time here to develop my game designing skills, meet like-minded friends in classes, and to connect with the
                    resources the school offers for game designers.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">I like to think of myself as very empathic and hard-working. I have had plenty of experience being a part of a team as well as leading a team and communication is definitely something that is needed for any project. I always get my side
                    of the project done in time in order for the team to move forward and stay on track.</p>

                <h1 class="box-em matter-html">My Interests</h1>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">My favorite types of games are puzzle games. I have always loved solving puzzles and really thinking about problems to solve them. A lot of the game ideas I come up with have puzzle elements in them as I also find puzzles fun to design
                    and come up with. Some of my favorite puzzle games are Baba Is You, FEZ, Mini Motorways, Portal 2, and Into The Breach.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">I also am very interested in randomness and procedural generation in games, whether that means making random worlds for the player to walk around in or loot tables for chest drops. I feel that randomness is a way to infinitely expand upon
                    any game idea and make each gameplay experience unique from the last. With the same amount of assets you can get entirely new gameplay each time you start up the game. A lot of my game ideas incorporate randomness as well.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">My favorite aspects of game development are definitely gameplay programming and level design. I love getting in and creating good mechanics and controls for the player as well as making the levels around them as they play. My dream job
                    would be to open my own indie game studio with a small team of people, but honestly any job where I get to develop games for a living is a win in my book.</p>
                <p class="box-reg matter-html">Outside of technology, I find space super interesting. I always like to just look up at the sky at night and relax. I also like to take walks or ride my bike around when I can to stay active. I also collect rubix cubes :)</p>
